# This is a very basic password generator.
The program will simply generate a password and then close.

[Download latest release](https://github.com/sarr-io/password-generator/releases/download/v1.0.0/passwordgen.exe)

# Features
- Very fast
- settings.json (creates the file on first run)
- log.txt (creates the file on first run)

### Configurable settings:
1. Password length
2. Uppercase chars
3. Lowercase chars
4. Number chars
5. Symbol chars
   
### **Note: Please do not use the log.txt as permanent password storage, it will clear itself after it gets too large (~1mb). I also do not see a reason the log file should be any larger so it is not configurable in settings.txt.**
